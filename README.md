# vesperML

vesperML is a machine learning and information retrieval library made for learning purposes.
The main ideia is to dig deep onto models suchs as LSTM and really understand what's going on.
It is also a place to study Software Engineering good practices in building a library.

Feel free to use any modules and models implemented here, as well as issuing any problems or improvements.
